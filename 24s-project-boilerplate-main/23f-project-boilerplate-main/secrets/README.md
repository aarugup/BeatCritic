#Overview
BeatCritic is a social media platform where people can post their critiques of music. The goal
of this platform is to connect people through music in a way that currently doesnt exist on the
market. A person can be either a user, follower, moderator or artist. They create a profile,
which requires a phone number an email and their name. Users can post reviews on songs
and rate them out of 5. Followers donâ€™t post reviews, rather, they comment on existing
reviews and can like them. Moderators monitor reviews and comments to ensure no
harrassment is occurring, and generate reports when it is, deleting those posts. Artists can
upload, update, and delete their own music to be revoewd, in order to learn about how people
feel about it. All reviews and comments can be viewed by anyone on the platform. This
creates a community where people can learn about new music and share their own
experiences with songs.
